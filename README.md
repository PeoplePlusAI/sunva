# Sunva AI Front End

Having conversations with the deaf can be a challenge. While there are so many live transcription and text to speech
tools available in the market, they do not cater to the needs of the deaf and hard of hearing and aren't designed from
accessibility focus. Often it could take a lot of time for the deaf person to read transcriptions and respond to them
depending on various factors from person to person. SUNVA AI intelligently simplifies and provides various filters on
the transcriptions to minimize the amount of time taken to read transcription and switch gaze between the screen and the
person while having the communication.
